# SoilMoistureMonitoring
Soil moisture is basically the content of water present in the soil. This can be measured using a soil moisture sensor which consists of two conducting probes that act as a probe. It can measure the moisture content in the soil based on the change in resistance between the two conducting plates. The resistance between the two conducting plates varies in an inverse manner with the amount of moisture present in the soil.
The purpose of this project is to detect and sense the amount of moisture present in a soil which is a crucial factor in agriculture.

SoilMoistureMonitoring is a simple function made for Nuclio (an open source and managed serverless platform that we can run on our home server). It uses RabbitMQ as broker to share MQTT messages around.
